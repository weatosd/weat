# Want to contribute to this project? Awesome!

First of all, thank you for your interest in being a contributor! We have a very small team, so any help we can get is greatly appreciated.

## Rules

  - All commits must have a brief summary of the commit, what you changed, and the impact it has
  - We exclusively use camelCase, except for the files and functions that pytest run, which use snake_case
  - We always separate list items with a space (ex: ['a', 'b', 'c'], not ['a','b','c'])
  - Please write tests alongside any developements you may contribute
  - **Important**: this is a group project, so remember to write clean code, and maintain good conduct
  
## Testing

We primarily use pytest for all tests, and require our pull requests to the <a href="https://github.com/weatosd/weat">**main branch**</a> to pass our Travis tests

# Thank you!
