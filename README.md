## about the project

This project tracks the progress of **weat Inc**'s application. The project is open source, and is meant to make creating a food delivery application easy. Feel free to contribute to this project, and to create any issues that you may find!


## main features
Here are some of the features that we have built and are currently working on:
  - An intuitive **<a href="https://github.com/weatosd/weat/tree/main/backend-database">database</a>** that mimics Firebase's **<a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore">Firestore</a>**, build using Python3.
  - An **<a href="https://github.com/weatosd/weat/tree/main/api">backend-api</a>** for interacting and serving data from the database.
  - Coming up: a frontend build from Python that mimics user actions
